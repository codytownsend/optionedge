Project Architecture & Design Principles
Core Design Philosophy

Modularity: Each component should be independently testable and replaceable
Data-Driven: All decisions based on quantifiable metrics and constraints
Fault Tolerance: System should gracefully handle API failures and data gaps
Scalability: Architecture should support expanding to more tickers and strategies
Auditability: Every trade recommendation should be traceable and explainable
