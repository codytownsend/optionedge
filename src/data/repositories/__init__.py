"""
Data repositories for the options trading engine.

This module provides the data access layer abstractions for:
- Options data retrieval and caching
- Market data access and storage
- Trade history and portfolio persistence

The repository pattern provides:
- Clean separation between business logic and data access
- Consistent interfaces for different data sources
- Easy testing through dependency injection
- Caching and performance optimization
