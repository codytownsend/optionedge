"""
Domain value objects for the options trading engine.

This module contains immutable value objects that represent domain concepts:
- Greeks: Enhanced Greeks calculations and analysis
- TradeMetrics: Comprehensive trade performance metrics
- Risk metrics and calculations

Value objects are immutable objects that represent domain concepts
through their attributes rather than their identity. They provide
rich behavior for calculations and comparisons while maintaining
data integrity through immutability.
