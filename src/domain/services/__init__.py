"""
Domain services for the options trading engine.

This module contains domain services that implement complex business logic
that doesn't naturally fit within a single entity:

- StrategyGenerator: Creates and validates options strategies
- RiskCalculator: Performs complex risk calculations and scenario analysis
- ScoringEngine: Implements multi-factor scoring models for trade ranking

Domain services orchestrate operations across multiple entities and
implement algorithms that require domain expertise but operate
on multiple domain objects.
