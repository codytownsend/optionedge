"""
Domain entities for the options trading engine.

This module contains the core business entities that represent
the fundamental concepts in our options trading domain:

- OptionContract: Rich domain model for options with business behaviors
- Strategy: Options trading strategies with execution logic
- Portfolio: Portfolio management with risk controls and position tracking

These entities contain the core business logic and behaviors,
not just data structures. They enforce business rules and
provide rich domain operations.
